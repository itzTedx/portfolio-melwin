## Logo Mark

This logo is creatively inspired by the combination of a dress hanger and a
smile emoji. By blending elements from both, it conveys a sense of fashion, joy, and
trustworthiness in its design.

The dress hanger represents the world of fashion and clothing, while the smile
emoji adds a touch of friendliness and approachability, ensuring that the brand
feels welcoming and reliable to its audience.
